# Project Idea: Task Management Application	
This project is a good starting point as it involves common features and allows you to practice various aspects of web development.
## Features:
### User Authentication:
User registration and login
Password reset functionality
Secure token-based authentication
### Task Creation and Management:
Create tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, priorities (high, medium, low)
Assign tasks to users (if applicable)
Mark tasks as completed/incomplete
Ability to filter tasks by status, priority, due date
### Project Management (Optional):
Create and manage projects
Assign tasks to specific projects
Track project progress
### Collaboration (Optional):
Allow users to collaborate on tasks (e.g., comments, task assignments)
### User Interface:
Clean and intuitive user interface using React components
Responsive design for different screen sizes
## Data Persistence:
Use Spring Boot to create a RESTful API for interacting with a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
## React Implementation:
Component-based structure: Break down the UI into reusable components (e.g., TaskList, TaskForm, LoginForm)
State management: Utilize React's state management solutions like useState or useContext for managing application data.
Data fetching and API calls: Use fetch or libraries like axios to make requests to the Spring Boot backend.
Routing: Implement client-side routing using React Router to navigate between different pages (e.g., login, task list, task details).
## Spring Boot Backend:
+ RESTful API: Design and implement RESTful endpoints for handling user authentication, task creation/retrieval/updates, and other application logic.
+ Data modeling: Create Java classes to represent your data (e.g., User, Task, Project) and define relationships between them.
+ Database integration: Integrate with your chosen database using Spring Data JPA or Spring Data MongoDB.
+ Security: Implement security measures such as authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
# Benefits of this project:
+ Learn core React concepts: Components, state management, routing, data fetching
+ Practice Spring Boot fundamentals: RESTful APIs, database integration, security
+ Build a practical application: Gain experience in building a real-world application with a user interface and backend
+ Improve your skills: Develop a solid foundation in full-stack web development

        Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and focus on building and testing features incrementally.
        This will help you stay motivated and avoid getting overwhelmed
